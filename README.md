# Wallpapers

This is a backup of all my wallpapers. I've gotten most of them from [Unsplash,](https://unsplash.com) but some I have gotten from various Linux distros like [elementary OS.](https://elementary.io) They are all landscapes, macros or abstract/texture images.

If one of these photos is yours and you would like me to remove them, please let me know via an issue and I will happily do so.
